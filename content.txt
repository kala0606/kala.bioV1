Hello -
My name is Ujjwal. I am a generativev artist, creative technologist and an educattor.

My work is an exploration of cycles—of moments, of meaning—inviting others to pause, reflect, and find beauty in the ever-changing present. seek patterns and rhythms, weaving time and technology into stories that unfold in unexpected ways.
